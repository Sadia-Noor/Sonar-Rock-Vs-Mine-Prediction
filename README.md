## Introduction
The project aims to predict whether an object detected by sonar data is a rock or a mine using machine learning, specifically employing the Logistic Regression algorithm. Sonar data is a powerful tool for underwater object detection, and this project leverages it to build a binary classification model. The Logistic Regression model is trained on a dataset containing features extracted from sonar signals, and its performance is evaluated based on accuracy metrics. The ultimate goal is to provide a reliable system for distinguishing between rocks and mines in sonar data, with potential applications in underwater navigation and security.
